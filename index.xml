I figured it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too hard and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t need to write any code, but as it turned out, I ended up having to resort to some Python to get the job done.
I had my Premiere Pro sequence all set up with all the intros chopped up and ready to go, but when I wanted to add text displaying the name and date of the current clip, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out how to do it in Premiere Pro.</description></item><item><title>Accessing Synology DSM internal databases and exporting Synology Photo albums</title><link>https://ferraridavide.github.io/posts/accessing-synology-dsm-database/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Nov 2022 22:55:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ferraridavide.github.io/posts/accessing-synology-dsm-database/</guid><description>One of the reasons that lead me to finally get a Synology NAS was that i needed a simple and reliable way to solve the chaotic photo situation i had going on, all of my and my familyâ€™s photos were spread over multiple hard drives and other mediums, scattered in unorganized random folders, to put it simply, they were all over the place.
I was looking for a solution that is reliable, easily maintainable, and that would allow me to neatly organize all of my photos in a single place, something that has fine-grained control over photo access permissions with a user system, and with an intuitive enough user interface that my tech-illiterate family members could have easy access to our photos.</description></item><item><title>Skills</title><link>https://ferraridavide.github.io/skills/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ferraridavide.github.io/skills/</guid><description>C#
