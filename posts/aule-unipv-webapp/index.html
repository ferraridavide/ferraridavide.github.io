I’d end up wandering through the hallways of Nave, moving from building to building, trying to find an empty classroom where my friends and I could settle in.\nSo when the Web Technologies course asked us to create a project for the final exam, I already knew what I wanted to build.\nI was thinking of something simple that would save me (and other students) the hassle of running around campus trying to find a free room. That’s how Aule UniPV came to life—a web app that puts all the classroom availability data in one clean, easy-to-use interface. No more wandering—just a quick look, and you know exactly where to go.\nThe idea Aule UniPV pulls data from the official classroom schedules daily and shows it in a friendly, easy-to-use way. Classrooms are presented as a stack of swipable cards, making it super simple to just swipe through and find what’s free.\nIf you need more details, there’s a full list of all available classrooms, sorted by availability. You can easily search and filter by features like projectors, electrical outlets, windows, blackboards, and more—just a swipe away. Aule UniPV helps you see exactly what each classroom has, so you can pick the best spot for your needs. Plus, you can bookmark your favorite classrooms to find them even faster next time.\nThe stack Building Aule UniPV was actually a lot of fun and gave me the opportunity to check out some new platforms and libraries I hadn’t worked with before. I got to dive into Supabase, which turned out to be a great backend solution for a simple project like this, especially thanks to its generous free tier. On the front end, I used Framer Motion to create playful interactions like the card swiping feature, which makes browsing classrooms a little more intuitive and enjoyable.\nThe frontend of Aule UniPV was built in React with TailwindCSS for rapid UI prototyping, the idea was to create something that felt responsive and interactive, so the user experience was as smooth as possible. I also used TanStack Table to provide a sophisticated data grid, which makes filtering classrooms fast and effective.\nThe backend is powered by Supabase, which turned out to be a solid choice for this project. It handled authentication, integrating with Google Cloud so that only students from the universitadipavia.it domain could report classroom issues, and edge functions for pulling updated data from the official classroom schedules.\nEvery morning at 6 AM, Aule UniPV automatically fetches the latest schedule information. This setup involves scheduled jobs that trigger queries to pull and update classroom availability data from the official calendars. By leveraging the pg_cron extension for PostgreSQL the system keeps everything in sync, ensuring users always have up-to-date information without manual intervention.\nThe project is hosted on GitHub Pages, with GitHub Actions seamlessly managing deployment. Every push triggers an automatic build and deployment, making the process effortless and allowing for rapid iteration on features and bug fixes.\n","wordCount":"515","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://ferraridavide.github.io/posts/aule-unipv-webapp/images/hero.jpg","datePublished":"2024-10-04T08:36:40Z","dateModified":"2024-10-04T08:36:40Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://ferraridavide.github.io/posts/aule-unipv-webapp/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Davide Ferrari","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ferraridavide.github.io/favicon.png"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://ferraridavide.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Davide Ferrari (Alt + H)">Davide Ferrari</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://ferraridavide.github.io/posts title=Blog><span>Blog</span></a></li><li><a href=https://ferraridavide.github.io/skills/ title=Skills><span>Skills</span></a></li><li><a href=https://ferraridavide.github.io/updates/ title=Updates><span>Updates</span></a></li><li><a href=https://ferraridavide.github.io/davideferrari.asc title=PGP><span>PGP</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://ferraridavide.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://ferraridavide.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Aule UniPV: A simple way to find an empty classroom</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-10-04 08:36:40 +0000 UTC'>October 4, 2024</span></div></header><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=lazy srcset="https://ferraridavide.github.io/posts/aule-unipv-webapp/images/hero_hu8083bc3b5ee845b155d7538b2fefda6a_371845_360x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 360w ,https://ferraridavide.github.io/posts/aule-unipv-webapp/images/hero_hu8083bc3b5ee845b155d7538b2fefda6a_371845_480x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 480w ,https://ferraridavide.github.io/posts/aule-unipv-webapp/images/hero_hu8083bc3b5ee845b155d7538b2fefda6a_371845_720x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 720w ,https://ferraridavide.github.io/posts/aule-unipv-webapp/images/hero_hu8083bc3b5ee845b155d7538b2fefda6a_371845_1080x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 1080w ,https://ferraridavide.github.io/posts/aule-unipv-webapp/images/hero_hu8083bc3b5ee845b155d7538b2fefda6a_371845_1500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 1500w ,https://ferraridavide.github.io/posts/aule-unipv-webapp/images/hero.jpg 1628w" sizes="(min-width: 768px) 720px, 100vw" src=https://ferraridavide.github.io/posts/aule-unipv-webapp/images/hero.jpg alt width=1628 height=916></figure><div class=post-content><p>Since starting university, my class schedule has been all over the place, often leaving me with random gaps to fill.
