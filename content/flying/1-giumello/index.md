This was my first time flying at Alpe Giumello. I completed two flights: one in the early afternoon and another around 4pm.

During the second flight, I launched westward, passing close to the [Big Bench 223](https://maps.app.goo.gl/G3rno3ph7wJbKR4V6). I could see people sitting on it and waved at them. Looking up, I could see the three branches of Lake Como through a light haze before making a U-turn back towards the landing site.

Both flights were smooth, without turbulence or thermals.
