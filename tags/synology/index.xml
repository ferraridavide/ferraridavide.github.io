I was looking for a solution that is reliable, easily maintainable, and that would allow me to neatly organize all of my photos in a single place, something that has fine-grained control over photo access permissions with a user system, and with an intuitive enough user interface that my tech-illiterate family members could have easy access to our photos.</description></item></channel></rss>
